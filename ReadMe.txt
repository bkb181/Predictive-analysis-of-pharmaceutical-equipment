There are total of 9 model for the predictive analysis of the equipment.

SVM-RBF(Radial Basis Function) and LSTM works here better out of total modelbest 

But based on the dataset best model may change.

LSTM used here will play vital role in future prediction of the status of equipment.

We have loaded the code for preprocessing task as well for clearification of entire process.

We used some standard dataset downloaded from their a machine learning repositery (uci), we have mentioned 
that reference in the ppt.

We have built a software that will help in handling all the activities of the equipment of 
pharmaceutical industry by a single user. We have created a .exe file that can be supported by 
windows operating system.

We have explored every signle possibility of the problem and their possible solution. We have decsribed 
these things in ppt file.
